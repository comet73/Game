# Game
Engine to play (tabletop) games. Focused on implementing the rules, not a great visualisation.

Intended use as engine for games varying from TicTacToe to MtG.

Should be usable for single player and multi player games.

While the core parts should focus on implmenting and enforcing game rules,
a REST API is envisioned to allow for interaction - possibly by bot implemantions.
Visualization and interaction possilby with a web client using some trendy JavaScript/UI Framework.
